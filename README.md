1.	What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?
	When I was spending a lot of time exploring music, there wasn't spotify(even iTunes didn't really have a store).
	I would use this one website called it-leaked to that would let me search artists and songs and then give
	me suggestions to related artists and other songs. This was how I basically discovered LIFE. With my project,
	someone needing new music can use my site to put in a song they really like and find related songs/artists.

2.	What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?
http://students.washington.edu/gabalex/info343/spotify-template/index.html

3.	Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
	Someone in the TE lab helped me with iterating through my array. I didn't know how to call the object because it was 2 arrays but he
	said if I just use [0,1,2] it would work. 

4.	Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
	9 hours. A lot of it was exploring the different API endpoints. An hour and a half was dedicated to finding a bug
	that turned out to be a misplaced quotation mark..yes..a misplaced quotation..

5.	Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
	I think this challenge was really fun and seeing how my website functions made me really wish I had this back when I was
	looking for music. I don't think there really is much to warn about, except to have fun with it.
